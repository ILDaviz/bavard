- **Production-ready features:** Built-in support for Soft Deletes, Automatic Timestamps, and Global Scopes out of the box.
- **Offline-first ready:** Native support for client-side UUIDs and a driver-agnostic architecture, ideal for local-first applications.
- **Dirty Checking:** Optimized database updates by tracking only the attributes that have actually changed.
- **Eager Loading:** Powerful eager loading system to eliminate N+1 query problems.
